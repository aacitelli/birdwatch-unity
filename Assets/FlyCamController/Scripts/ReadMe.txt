FlyCamController - 2019 Gary Hatfield

To get fully set up for use only 2 steps are required:

1. Drag FlyCamController Prefab into your scene.

2. Go to Edit > Project Settings > Input and Right Click Horizontal Input Axis > Duplicate Array Element and Rename the new Element to "Lateral". 
   Remap the input to whatever you like, I recommend Q and E and Left Ctrl and Space.
